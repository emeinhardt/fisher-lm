    " 1. Double-parentheses removal: Sequences of word tokens where the transcriber wasn't sure what was said are delimited by double parentheses; if the transcriber was fairly confident what was said, their guess is inside the parentheses. These parentheses are removed. If there's something (besides whitespace) inside the parentheses, that's what remains; if there was nothing inside the parentheses, the parenthesis-surrounded whitespace was replaced with `<rem>`.\n",
    " 2. Non-speech noise removal: Noises that aren't speech (e.g. `[laugh]`) are delimited in square brackets. All such square-bracket delimited character sequences are removed. Note that 'utterances' with no wordforms (i.e. that in the original transcription contain only non-speech noises) are not included in post-processed data intended for use with a language model.\n",
    " 3. Broken-off wordform removal: Wordforms that a speaker doesn't produce in their entirety (e.g. they break off production somewhere in the middle of the word and/or resume somewhere in the middle of a word) end or begin with a dash. All such character sequences are removed and replaced with `<rem>`.\n",
